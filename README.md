# AI For Good Technical Curriculum

## [Workshop 1](Workshop%20%231)
*26 February 2020*

We're going to start with a run through of the fundamentals of data science, and give you the chance to explore the various modes of working with the Azure Machine Learning Service (AML) to build and deploy your own custom machine learning models.

**Session objectives:**
- learn how to use the **designer** to work with Azure-ML in a code-free mode ([Lab1 - part 1](Workshop%20%231/Lab1.md))
- learn how to **deploy** a model so that it is available for inference via an API ([Lab1 - part 2](Workshop%20%231/Lab1.md))
- know where to find additional labs that walk through some other machine learning scenarios at the foundational level, with further code-free and python options ([Fundamentals Material](Workshop%20%23#1/Fundamentals%20Material%20for%20Feb%2026%20session.md))

## [Workshop 2](Workshop%20%232)
*19 March 2020*

This session focusses on an exploration of the Azure Cognitive Services, a series of pre-trained and customisable models that you can integrate into your applications.

**Session objectives:**
- gain an overview of the available cognitive services and how best to explore their capabilities
- gain hands-on experience of integrating cognitive services into end-to-end applications
