# Workshop 2 - 2nd Fundamentals Session

### Prerequisites for the Cohort attending the session:

❗️❗️ **Please ensure that all attendees have access to their organisation's subscriptions and are able to provision resources within them.** ❗️❗️

Work through the following mini-courses on mslearn:
- [Evaluate text with Azure Cognitive Language Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/evaluate-text-with-language-services/)
- [Process and translate speech with Azure Cognitive Speech Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/translate-speech-with-speech-services/)


## Ways of working

This is our first fully remote session

[any additional pointers here - e.g feedback, whiteboard, interactivity in teams]

### Some tips and tricks to feel at home in the cloud:

From the Azure ML lab in the first fundamentals session, you will have got a good idea of the intended use of the `Datasets` feature to manage, version, and track your datasets through the ML development process. Sometimes, however, you just want to get started quickly with some data for some brief experiements: 

#### Connect to your DSVM from VS code
VS code has a great little trick to feel like you've really beefed up your local machine: Develop as if on your local machine, but execute on a remote machine, such as your Azure ML Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM).

- Create a DSVM in Azure ML with SSH option enabled
- Create an SSH Key
- Install VSCode Remote Development Pack
- Update config file (via command menu)
- Connect to Remote

#### Mount blob storage into your AML Virtual Machines with blobFuse
