## Additional Material 
###Some tips and tricks to feel at home in the cloud:

From the Azure ML documentation, you will have got a good idea of the intended use of the `Datasets` feature to manage, version, and track your datasets through the ML development process. Sometimes, however, you just want to get started quickly with some data for some brief experiements, 

### Connect to your DSVM from VS code
VS code has a great little trick to feel like you've really beefed up your local machine: Develop as if on your local machine, but execute on a remote machine, such as your Azure ML Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM).

Create a DSVM in Azure ML with SSH option enabled

Create an SSH Key

Install VSCode Remote Development Pack

Update config file (via command menu)

Connect to Remote

### Mount blob storage into your DSVM with blobFuse




### Configure your browser as an Azure Portal app on your machine
