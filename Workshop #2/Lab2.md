## Ways of working

This is our first fully remote session. We want to try and emulate the feeling of being in a room together as much as we can, and we ask you to support us in this effort:
- ðŸ™ˆ Please consider turning video on. (Note the ['blur background' feature](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Blur-your-background-in-a-Teams-meeting-f77a2381-443a-499d-825e-509a140f4780)!)
- ðŸ™‹ Do not hesitate to interact with us and with each other, throughout presentations and sessions, either via chat or via voice 
- ðŸ‘‹ It is fine to step away during sessions if you need to, but please let us know with a quick note in the chat if you do so.
- ðŸ‘¾ GIFs, memes and fun in the chat are allowed (within the normal SFW bounds of course). Enjoy the day!
