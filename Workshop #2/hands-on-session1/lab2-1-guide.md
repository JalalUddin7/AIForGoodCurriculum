This introduces you to to working with pre-trained models from the Azure Cognitive Services. We will focus on the **[tbc] Service** as an example.

## Explore the cognitive services with the Intelligent Kiosk

[To Do]
- add instructions to install the intelligent kiosk locally from the publicly downloadable app (limited public service instances)
- add instructions to install the kiosk with own service instances
- walk through one example in kiosk - point to [documented scenarios](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-IntelligentKiosk#Scenarios) for others

[Consider adapting part of these instructions generally as a lab setup so that participants have all the cognitive service instances:]
